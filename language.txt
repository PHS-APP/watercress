FFI:
tsj845's proposal:
    FFI is done via wrapper functions
    these functions are created using an explicit marker
    these functions are the only way to call foreign functions
    data returned by foreign functions cannot leave the wrapper function, it must be copied to a Watercress-native data structure
    wrapper functions are responsable for any necessary deallocation of foreign objects
